# RediGo 🔴🐹

> 🚧 **Work in Progress**  
> This project is still under active development. Not all Redis features are implemented yet. Expect bugs, missing commands, and rough edges!

A minimal Redis clone written in Go — built from scratch for learning, hacking, and fun.

Redigo is an in-memory key-value store server that mimics some core features of Redis, including basic commands, concurrency safety, and TCP communication.
